                <strong>AHMAD JANJUA</strong>
                <p>--------------------------</p>
            
                <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Ahmad Janjua, and I am a fourth-year Software Engineering student
                    at the University of Calgary. On this page, you'll find links to my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>
                    and some of my <a href="gallery.html">photography</a>. Take a look around, and if you have any questions,
                    feel free to reach out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-j/">me</a>!
                </p>
            
                <p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
                <p>Why Software Engineering?</p>
                <p>Growing up, I was always drawn to learning about how things worked. Naturally, when it came time to select
                    a degree for university, I felt that engineering would help me understand how technology is developed.
                    I originally planned on pursuing mechanical engineering since I enjoyed making models and designing things.
                    However, in my first-year course, I fell in love with the problem-solving process involved in software development.
                    Since then, I have been exploring software engineering both in school and as a hobby.
                </p>
            
                <p>What areas am I interested in?</p>
                <p>Throughout my degree, I have explored a variety of software engineering fields. My favorite interests generally fall
                    into two categories. The first is challenging and clever problem solving, which includes game development, writing
                    and optimizing algorithms, and solving business and engineering problems through innovative software solutions.
                    The second is exploring and leveraging existing ingenious solutions to address problems relevant to me, such as
                    those found in machine learning, embedded systems, and cryptography.
                </p>
            
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
                <p>My goal is to find an environment where I can challenge myself and refine my skills as an engineer and problem solver.
                    I aim to leverage my abilities to create innovative solutions to complex engineering and business challenges. Ultimately,
                    I hope to discover a niche where I can truly excel.
                </p>
